DiscordBot

I was very interested in how Slack and Discord bot are built. I use discord quite often for gaming, for school and for chatting with friends
and building a discord bot would be very useful for me!

Using pythong and discord.py I was able to add a few features to the discord bot. Current commands are:

- /hello # replies to the user
- /goodbye # replies to the user
- /join # join a voice channel the user is in
- /leave # leaves a voice channel
- /play URL # plays the music in the youtube link provided, given that the bot is in the voice channel
- /pause /stop # pause and stops the music playing
- /queue # currently working on this feature. If more add URLs to play, the bot will add them to the queue.

Chat bot that can join voice chats and play youtube music (Python, Discord.py, FFmpeg, youtube_dl)
